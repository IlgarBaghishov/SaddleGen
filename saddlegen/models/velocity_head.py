Velocity head: projects per-atom irreps to per-atom velocity vectors.

`depth=1` (default) mirrors fairchem's `Linear_Force_Head` exactly — a single
`SO3_Linear(C, 1, lmax=1)` whose l=1 output is reshaped to (N, 3). `depth ≥ 2`
stacks `SO3_Linear(C, C, lmax=1) → UMAGate → ...` with equivariant Gate-style
activations before the final projection.

Time conditioning (FiLM, AdaLN-zero style). A sinusoidal embedding of flow-time
t ∈ [0, 1] is passed through a small MLP that outputs 2C features, split into:
    - a per-channel scalar bias added to the l=0 channels, and
    - a per-channel scalar factor (1 + γ) multiplying the l≥1 channels.
Both operations are SO(3)-equivariant because `t` is a scalar (invariant),
so every derived per-atom per-channel factor is SO(3)-invariant. Multiplying
an invariant scalar by an l=ℓ feature yields an l=ℓ feature — see the proof
in CLAUDE.md §"Why time FiLM is equivariant". The MLP's last layer is
zero-initialized, so at init (bias=0, γ=0) the head is numerically identical
to fairchem's `Linear_Force_Head`; time-dependence is learned during training.

A plain additive l=0 bias alone would NOT propagate `t` to the output because
`SO3_Linear` keeps l-channels decoupled — the l=0 signal never reaches the
l=1 projection. The multiplicative gate on l≥1 is what lets `t` actually matter.

The architecture consumes only the l=0,1 slice of the input — higher-l features
are dropped, matching UMA's own `Linear_Force_Head` (l>1 is not needed to
produce a 3-vector output and dropping it halves the parameter count).

    **Bug fix (2026-04-21).** The previous implementation used the stock
    Transformer positional-encoding base of 10000, which is calibrated for
    token positions up to ~10k (or DDPM-style discretized time T=1000). On
    continuous flow-time in `[0, 1]`, that makes the highest-frequency dim
    `sin(10000^{-31/32} · t) ≈ sin(1.3e-4 · t) ≈ 0` for the whole interval,

    the existing ice-cream-cone training recipe.

    **Mode 1 (delta_endpoint_channels > 0).** A per-atom partner-displacement
    vector `Δ_partner = partner − x_t` (MIC-shortest image) is injected into
    the head before the time-FiLM. Equivariance construction:

      • Build a single-channel irrep tensor with l=0 = ‖Δ‖, l=1 = Δ, l≥2 = 0.
      • `delta_proj` (an `SO3_Linear(1, C_d, lmax)`) expands it to `C_d` channels.
      • Concat with UMA's `(N, num_sph, sphere_channels)` features along the
        channel axis → `(N, num_sph, sphere_channels + C_d)`.
      • `delta_fuse` (an `SO3_Linear(sphere_channels + C_d, sphere_channels, lmax)`)
        mixes UMA channels and Δ channels per-l (l=0↔l=0 only, l=1↔l=1 only —
        SO3_Linear keeps paths decoupled, which is required for equivariance).
      • Then proceed exactly as Mode 0 (time-FiLM on l=0,1 slice; final SO3_Linear).

    `delta_proj` is zero-initialised (weight and bias), so at init Δ has zero
    contribution and the Mode-1 head is numerically identical to the Mode-0
    head. The "partner direction" signal is learned from Mode-1 training data,
    starting from the validated Mode-0 baseline architecturally.

    Why not e3nn / direct concat without `delta_proj`? `SO3_Linear` requires
    a fixed channel count to mix; `delta_proj`'s sole job is to expand a
    1-channel input to `C_d` channels so the fuse layer has enough room to
    learn meaningful UMA↔Δ mixings. `C_d = 32` (default) gives the head plenty
    of representational headroom (4 DOF input → 32 channels mirrors the time
    embedding's 1 DOF → 64 channels expansion).
